# SFD 2017 - Creative Coding and Data Visualization

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free Software. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.

In Puducherry, we celebrated this year's SFD on 1st October. My team put up a stall on Data Visualization and Creative Coding.

The code for the sketches are available at [slides/sketches/](slides/sketches).
